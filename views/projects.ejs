                This project generates an array of cells based on Wolfram's elementary cellular 
                automata rules. The user specifies input parameters such as number of cells and 
                amount of time, and the program propogates the values through an array based on 
                the specified rule. The program also allows for reading an array from a text 
                file, writing an array to a text file, and printing an array to the console. The 
                program allows for graphical representation of the array, either static or 
                scrolling, using SDL. You can read more about cellular automata

                This program takes a C++ header file as input and creates a matching C++ class 
                file with empty function definitions. I was motivated to create this program 
                after starting several projects and having to go through the tedious process of 
                writing redundant code in both header and class files.

                This project is a mancala simulator supporting human and AI players. 
                Multipurpose, with the ability to play single games against either a player or a 
                variable difficulty AI, or simulate thousands of games against different AIs to 
                evaluate performance. Limited functionality in creating AI through machine 
                learning.

                This program simulates the spread of a virus through a population. The 
                population is made up of individuals, who each have a status (healthy, infected, 
                or immune). Initially, one individual is infected while the rest are healthy. 
                The simulation takes place over multiple time steps. During each time step, 
                individuals are put into random groups of sizes between 1 and [max group size]. 
                If a healthy individual is grouped with an infected individual, the healthy 
                individual becomes infected. After a certain amount of time, infected 
                individuals become immune, and can no longer become infected or spread 
                infection. This program was inspired by the COVID-19 epidemic and the effects 
                social distancing had to slow it.

                This project is a simple game comprised of two teams of characters arranged in a 
                2x4 grid. Each character is one of several jobs (often referred to as classes), 
                with various stats and actions. Each action can damage other character(s), heal 
                other character(s), swap places with another character, or a combination of the 
                three. Each action is only usable from certain positions on the grid, and has 
                specified target positions from each valid position.

                This program simulates many 5 and 7 card poker hands, and compiles statistics 
                about their frequency which it prints to the console.
